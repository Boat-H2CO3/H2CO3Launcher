/**
 * A binding holding the value of an indirect source. The indirect source results from
 * applying a mapping to the given source.
 *
 * <p>Implementation:
 *
 * <p>In a flat mapped binding there are always two subscriptions involved:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The subscription on its source</li>
 * <li>The subscription on the value resulting from the mapping of the source: the indirect source</li>
 * </ul>
 * The subscription on its given source is present when this binding itself is observed and not present otherwise.
 *
 * <p>The subscription on the indirect source must change whenever the value of the given source changes or is invalidated. More
 * specifically, when the given source is invalidated the indirect subscription should be removed, and when it is revalidated it
 * should resubscribe to the newly calculated indirect source. The binding avoids resubscribing when only the value of
 * the indirect source changes.
 *
 * @param <S> the type of the source
 * @param <T> the type of the resulting binding
